# RECURSION
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called **Recursion** and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.
This repository contains C++ implementations of the codes of the course [Recursion in Programming - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJDJ0kBx2LM) by FreeCodeCamp.org.

These are not the exact translation, but the core logic is same.
